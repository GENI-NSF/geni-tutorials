LAYER 2 PING
=================

Description
==============
This software is a Layer 2 Ping, that uses a custom ETH_TYPE for sending
Ethernet frames. There are two parts on the software, the Listener and the 
Sender. The Listener, listens for packets of a specific ETH_TYPE and replies. 
The sender sends Ethernet frames to a specific MAC Address and waits for a reply. 
The sender sends a mathematical challenge (an addition of two numbers) to the
listener and the listener replies with the answer to that challenge. 

Dependencies
===============
PingPlus needs gcc installed in order to be able to compile it. 

Compile 
=========
This software has been tested on Fedora 10 and Ubuntu 10.0.4.
To compile the software follow these steps 
  * untar the package (tar xvfz pingPlus.tar.gz)
  * this will create a directory pingPlus, cd to that directory
    (cd pingPlus)
  * Run make (make). This will produce two executables :
      - pingPlus
      - pingPlusListener

Test
=====
pingPlusListener takes one argument:
  * eth_type : is the ETH_TYPE to use for the Ethernet frames
  e.g. pingPlusListener 10111

pingPlus takes four arguments (the fourth is optional)
  * remote-host : the MAC address of host in 00:11:22:33:44:55 form.
  * interface : the name of local Ethernet interface on which to send.
  * eth_type : is the ETH_TYPE to use for the Ethernet frames.
  * num_pkts option argument that specifies how many packets to send, default is 1.

After compiling, to test the software you will need two terminals on 
the same host:
   * In terminal 1 and while under the pingPlus directory type:
     sudo ./pingPlustListener 10111
   * In terminal 1 and while under the pingPlus directory type:
     sudo ./pingPlus <eth_address_of_host> <name_of_intf> 10111

You should see on terminal 1, the receiver getting the request and replying and 
on terminal 2 the answer to the ping. 

To terminate the pingPlusListener press Ctrl-c. 

Software Dependencies
======================
To compile the software you will need to install the gcc and make packages. 

UBUNTU
